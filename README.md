## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms form the backbone of computer science and play a crucial role in problem-solving and software development. Understanding and implementing efficient data structures and algorithms are essential skills for every programmer.

This repository focuses on implementing data structures and algorithms using the C programming language. C is a popular choice for DSA due to its low-level control, efficiency, and direct memory manipulation capabilities. By learning DSA in C, developers gain a deep understanding of how data structures and algorithms work at a lower level.

## Data Structures

The repository covers a wide range of data structures, including:

- **Arrays**: Linear data structure to store a collection of elements.
- **Linked Lists**: Dynamic data structure composed of nodes connected through pointers.
- **Stacks**: LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure.
- **Queues**: FIFO (First-In, First-Out) data structure.
- **Trees**: Non-linear hierarchical data structure with nodes connected by edges.
- **Graphs**: Non-linear data structure composed of vertices and edges.
- **Hash Tables**: Data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function.
- **Heaps**: Specialized tree-based data structure for efficient priority queue operations.

Each data structure is implemented in C, accompanied by detailed explanations and example use cases. The implementations emphasize clarity, efficiency, and correctness, serving as a solid foundation for building more complex algorithms and applications.

## Algorithms

The repository also includes a variety of algorithms, such as:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Implementations of searching algorithms like Linear Search, Binary Search, and Hashing.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Implementations of graph traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), as well as algorithms for shortest paths and minimum spanning trees.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solutions to problems that utilize dynamic programming techniques, including memoization and tabulation.
- **String Algorithms**: Implementations of string manipulation algorithms like String Matching and Pattern Searching.

The algorithms are implemented in C and are accompanied by clear explanations, step-by-step breakdowns, and example usage. Understanding these algorithms provides a solid foundation for solving a wide range of programming problems efficiently.

## Usage

To use this repository, simply clone it to your local development environment:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

You can then navigate through the various folders to find the desired data structure or algorithm implementation. Each folder contains a C source file along with relevant comments and explanations. Compile the source files using a C compiler and run the executable to see the code in action.

Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with the implementations. It is highly encouraged to test and verify the code against different scenarios and edge cases.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional implementations of data structures and algorithms, please submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the established coding style and provide clear explanations along with your code changes.
